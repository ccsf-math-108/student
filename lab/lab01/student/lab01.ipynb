    "This web application is called a Jupyter notebook and is part of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). A notebook is a place to host share explanatory content intended for humans usually in association with computational programs and their results. This notebook format supports reproducible computational research where anyone with access to the notebook and the relevant data will more than likely be able to reproduce the work done by the original researchers. Reproducibility is part of the backbone of modern scientific research. Notebook files on a computer end in `.ipynb`. This file extension is a reference to the IPython programming environment developed by [Fernando Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer)). You'll notice that these notebooks can be edited and run on several different platforms such as the [CCSF JupyterHub](https://ccsf.cloudbank.2i2c.cloud/), [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc. The different platforms allow you to interact with the notebooks in slightly different ways, but the main components of a notebook typically persist through those differences.\n",
