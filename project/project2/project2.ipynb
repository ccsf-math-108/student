    "    * For this assignment, you are allowed to complete this project with a partner, but you are not required to work with a partner.\n",

    "    * Keep in mind that for group assignments, one submission will count for the entire group in Canvas.\n",
    "    * You and your partner will receive the same grade for this project.\n",
    "* **Code Sharing.** Don't share your code directly with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for our exams and potentially for future work in this field. If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem or you can focus on a specific part of a task.\n",
    "* **Support.** You are not alone! Meet with your instructor or the tutors, post questions on Canvas or the student Discord channel, and talk to your classmates during our meetings. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, talk to your instructor or a tutor.\n",
    "* **Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",
    "* **Open Response Tasks:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide and generate the graphs as requested. Usually, the point number for the open response tasks corresponds to the number of things you need to address in your response.\n",
    "* **Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in the first task, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",
    "* You are never expected to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like! \n",
